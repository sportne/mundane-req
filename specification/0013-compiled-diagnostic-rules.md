# Compiled diagnostic rule catalog

These identifiers preserve existing interpreter meanings in semantic output 0.1.
All current severities are error. Only input-unavailable and no-source-files have
phase input; all others have phase source. Messages are explanatory, not stable
API strings. Future additions require contract review; changed meanings need a
new rule identifier. Source contracts remain the authority for validity.
