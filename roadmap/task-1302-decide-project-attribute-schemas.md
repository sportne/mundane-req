# Task TC-1302: Decide Project Attribute Schemas

Status: Planned

Roadmap stage: 13

Type: Decision

Depends on: TC-1301, TC-1203

Unlocks: follow-up work selected by the completion decision

## Question

How should a project declare and select the bounded typed attributes chosen by
TC-1301 without hidden configuration or ambiguous source interpretation?

## Outcome

A written schema/syntax decision and worked examples enable separately scoped
future implementation cards; this card does not authorize those implementations.

## Work

- Apply TC-1105's authoring-format decision, inherited through TC-1203's
  prerequisites. Compare declarations in the selected requirement representation
  with a narrowly scoped configuration format. Specify
  storage, version control, explicit selection versus directory discovery, roots,
  missing/invalid/ambiguous schemas, and single-file operation without project context.
- Decide naming restrictions, built-in/reserved conflicts, type/enumeration
  declarations, duplicate and unknown attributes, required values, multiplicity,
  defaults, and invalid values.
- Specify schema version/compatibility, no-schema behavior, imported schema
  selection, and reproducibility when a schema changes.
- Work through source attachment, semantic representation, deterministic formatter
  ordering and comment preservation without assigning comments invented ownership.
- Map propagation obligations to validation, semantic output, trace, views, ReqIF,
  and editor diagnostics/hover/completion; distinguish lossless support, best-effort
  mapping with visible loss, and explicit unsupported cases.
- Prepare bounded successor cards only after the decision: grammar/model/validation;
  formatting; interchange/output propagation; examples/testing/documentation; and
  individual editor capabilities where justified.

## Acceptance evidence

- A decision record precedes implementation and contains valid and invalid source
  and schema examples for every chosen rule, including isolated-file processing.
- A matrix states whether unchanged 0.1/0.2 projects without schemas remain valid
  and identifies any intentional breaking case and its migration note.
- Worked defaults and schema changes demonstrate what enters compiled semantics;
  generated output never becomes the attribute definition authority.
- The follow-up test plan names golden parsing/formatting, invalid schema/value,
  round-trip, property/mutation, and no-schema compatibility fixtures.
- Each proposed follow-up names this decision as a dependency; unselected syntax
  and unsupported ReqIF/editor behavior are not silently promised.

## Out of scope

- Implementing custom attributes, general metadata inheritance, a policy engine,
  or retroactively assigning assessment authority to descriptive labels.

## Compatibility and affected components

Likely components: future schema source, grammar, Interpreter, formatter, CLI input
selection, artifact contracts, experimental ReqIF adapter, and language reference.
Human IDs remain identity. Reconcile the old safety/allocation dispositions through
a new decision, preserving the historical reasoning.

## Completion decision

Select only a reviewable design whose no-schema and standalone-file cases are
explicit. If schema discovery, defaults, or type breadth makes the initial model
ambiguous, narrow it before creating implementation work.

## Planning refinement

Require the selected YAML/custom-source disposition to inform attribute schema
placement instead of assuming the current grammar will be extended. Existing
ownership, type-scope, and no-schema compatibility decisions remain required.
