# Task TC-0104: Select the Maintained Implementation Lineage

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 1

Type: Decision

Depends on: TC-0103

Unlocks: TC-0201

## Question

Should the first maintained implementation evolve from the experimental probe or be constructed alongside it and compared through conformance evidence?

## Outcome

A short decision record selects the implementation lineage and states which experiment code may be reused, retained as an oracle, or retired.

## Work

- Assess the 796-line probe's coupling among CLI, source discovery, parsing, validation, model, inventory, and trace query.
- Assess whether incremental extraction can preserve test evidence more safely than a parallel implementation.
- Identify ReqIF probe duplication that should not dictate the core architecture.
- Compare the smallest transition paths against formatter and separate-executable needs.
- Record the selected path and rollback condition.

## Acceptance evidence

- The decision names the maintained source location to be created by TC-0201.
- Reuse is justified component by component rather than by implementation convenience alone.
- Historical experiment reproducibility is preserved.
- The decision does not claim a stable Java API.

## Out of scope

- Performing the extraction.
- Selecting generalized compiler frameworks.
- Changing executable behavior or source semantics.

## Completion decision

Favor evolution when behavior can remain continuously covered; favor a parallel implementation when extracting concrete syntax and tool boundaries would otherwise distort the experiment. Do not maintain two implementations indefinitely without a stated comparison purpose.

## Result

[Research 0011](../research/0011-maintained-implementation-lineage.md) selects
a controlled extraction from the Experiment 0002 probe into one maintained
implementation. The probe remains a temporary behavioral oracle through
TC-0204 but will not become a product dependency or dictate class boundaries.

The decision assigns each probe concern to extraction, migration evidence, or
a later tool; keeps the ReqIF adapter outside the core; names `src/main/java`,
`src/test/java`, `build/maintained`, and the root `Makefile` as the maintained
project boundaries; and defines a rollback if controlled extraction would
create persistent duplicate parsers or distort requirement semantics. No Java
API or experimental option syntax is declared stable. A minimal cross-tool
exit convention is fixed, and annotated tag `reference-probe-0.2-audited`
pins the exact corrected oracle at commit `7cf9c58`.
