# Task TC-1305: Compile Project Attribute Artifacts

Status: Planned

Roadmap stage: 13

Type: Implementation

Depends on: TC-1302, TC-1303

Unlocks: TC-1306

## Question

Current compiled requirements contain seven fixed values. Emitting project
attributes as ignorable metadata would let existing consumers silently discard
values or interpret them without their declaration.

## Outcome

Versioned compiled requirements preserve explicit attribute values, the typed
schema snapshot and source provenance, with strict incomplete-output behavior.

## Work

- Publish the output 0.2/CLI contract from Research 0052 and add independent version declarations. Preserve old-format emission for existing source modes.
- Emit present attributes, null-or-complete schema definition, exact schema provenance, declaration locations and attribute name/value spans; no defaults or extra requirement identities.
- Canonicalize semantic maps and enum sets deterministically; retain semantic strings exactly and separate byte/source provenance from values.
- Read selected schema/source bytes once, enforce compiler root rules and publish no requirement records on invalid/incomplete input.
- Supply a small independent serialized fixture consumer for output verification; maintained linker/analyzer support belongs to TC-1306.

## Acceptance evidence

- Golden artifacts cover both types, required/optional absence, schema-free new source, invalid schema/value and Unicode locations. The independent consumer checks declarations and values, not only complete=true.
- Reversed file/attribute/declaration/enum order produces equal semantics; whitespace/comments/file moves change the appropriate provenance without changing meaning. Exact same inputs produce identical artifact bytes.
- New values cannot appear under old output identifiers; old source/output goldens remain unchanged. Invalid/input/output failures preserve current publication and exit rules.
- Worked schema changes produce the exact definition/value differences specified in Research 0053; no per-requirement digest is authored or introduced.
- Record schema/source fixtures, output/diagnostic goldens, JVM/native parity and authoritative verification. Document unsupported consumers and migration until TC-1306 lands.

## Out of scope

- Maintained linking, review-policy implementation, report/editor or ReqIF support; automatic schema registries or build orchestration.

## Compatibility and affected components

Introduce requirements output 0.2 for the selected new source; retain output 0.1
for old profiles. Likely components: SemanticArtifact, compiler CLI, source spans,
versions, output specifications and compiler fixtures. Compiled schema is derived
from checked-in declarations, not an alternative authoring file.

## Completion decision

Stop if consumers could mistake attributes for optional informational fields,
if output cannot identify the declaration snapshot, or if invalid input yields
partial usable records. Completion gives TC-1306 a tested serialized boundary.
