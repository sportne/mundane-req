# Task TC-0201: Establish the Maintained Java Project

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 2

Type: Implementation

Depends on: TC-0104

Unlocks: TC-0202

## Question

What is the smallest maintainable Java project layout that can build shared code and separate GraalVM native executables?

## Outcome

A maintained source and test area exists outside the historical experiments, with a reproducible JVM test command and native-image build path.

## Work

- Create only the source, test, and build boundaries required by the selected lineage.
- Select a minimal build arrangement compatible with Java 21 and the installed SDKMAN GraalVM.
- Keep generated classes and native binaries disposable and ignored.
- Provide one documented clean-checkout build command.
- Preserve historical experiment builds unchanged.

## Acceptance evidence

- A clean checkout runs the maintained test skeleton on the JVM.
- A minimal native-image smoke target builds without fallback mode.
- No database, server, plugin system, or unrelated dependency framework is introduced.
- The layout leaves room for three executable entry points without merging their responsibilities.

## Out of scope

- Implementing parser behavior.
- Publishing binaries for multiple platforms.
- Declaring package or API compatibility.

## Completion decision

Retain the build arrangement only if it is simpler than the tool code it supports and can produce independent executables without duplicated semantic implementations.

## Result

The repository now has conventional maintained roots at `src/main/java` and
`src/test/java`, a dependency-free root `Makefile`, and disposable output under
the already ignored `build/maintained` tree. `make test` compiles with Java 21
warnings treated as errors and runs the JVM skeleton. `make native-smoke`
builds and runs the same test-only entry point with GraalVM Native Image and
`--no-fallback`; `make verify` performs both checks.

No parser behavior, product executable, third-party dependency, database,
server, plugin system, or compatibility promise was introduced. Historical
experiment source and Makefiles remain unchanged. Separate future entry points
can be added under the maintained source root while sharing only the code that
the validator, formatter, and trace tools actually have in common.
