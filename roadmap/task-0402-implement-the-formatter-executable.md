# Task TC-0402: Implement the Formatter Executable

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 4

Type: Implementation

Depends on: TC-0401 and TC-0204

Unlocks: TC-0403

## Question

Can the selected formatting policy be implemented as an independent native tool over the shared concrete source representation?

## Outcome

`mundanereq-format` implements only the selected policy through safe check and output modes, with any in-place mode explicitly controlled.

## Work

- Render valid concrete source according to the selected canonical rules.
- Preserve comment text and relative order without semantic attachment.
- Preserve opaque math payloads exactly as the formatting contract requires.
- Implement check mode and standard-output behavior before or alongside in-place writing.
- Keep parsing shared while keeping rewrite logic local to the formatter.

## Acceptance evidence

- The formatter builds as its own GraalVM native image.
- It does not invoke `mundanereq-validate` at runtime.
- Invalid input is rejected with shared diagnostics rather than partially rewritten.
- Source order remains governed by the selected policy.
- No generated index or repository configuration is required.

## Out of scope

- Repair formatting of syntactically invalid files.
- Document composition or view ordering.
- Semantic editing or requirement migration.

## Completion decision

If implementation requires semantics not selected by TC-0401, stop and revise the policy rather than infer behavior from proximity or formatting convention.

## Result

`mundanereq-format` now implements exactly the two rewrites selected by
[Experiment 0008](../experiments/0008-formatting-policy/README.md) through
context-aware standard-output, check, and explicit write modes. The shared
interpreter exposes deterministic physical source selection so the formatter
can validate one complete source set once, while formatter-local
`SourceFormatter` rewrites only retained concrete lines.

The real formatter replaces the temporary `FormatBoundary` and builds as its
own no-fallback GraalVM native image. Boundary isolation starts it successfully
while each sibling executable is absent. Invalid input is reported with shared
diagnostics before output or replacement, and multi-file standard-output use
can name context inputs without writing them.

Focused JVM tests cover the Experiment 0008 golden result, context-resolved
relationships, check/write behavior, all-input prevalidation, and invocation.
The broader semantic-preservation, idempotence, comment/math, line-ending, mode,
and JVM/native matrix remains the purpose of TC-0403.
