# Task TC-1403: Recover Parser Diagnostics Safely

Status: Ready

Roadmap stage: 14

Type: Implementation and verification

Depends on: none

Unlocks: TC-1504

## Question

Can the parser report independent errors usefully while keeping recovered records
distinct from a valid complete source model?

## Outcome

Bounded record recovery preserves useful diagnostics and valid neighboring records
without allowing invalid input to pass validation, linking, or formatter write-back.

## Work

- Reproduce the current file-level ParseFailure catch: one syntax failure discards
  the returned record list for that file and may cause misleading dangling links
  from other files.
- Define safe synchronization at actual record boundaries, respecting math/body
  delimiters, and suppress or qualify downstream errors caused by missing parse data.
- Separate decoding, syntax recognition, semantic construction, and source-set
  validation only where required to preserve recovery state and diagnostic locations.
- Expose completeness explicitly for future compilation/editor consumers. Coordinate
  diagnostic ranges and partial-output rules with TC-1201 without blocking local
  strict-validation fixes on a new public output format.

## Acceptance evidence

- A fixture with two independent malformed records and valid neighbors yields both
  primary syntax diagnostics at the correct locations in deterministic order.
- Multiline math, missing terminators, malformed headers, invalid UTF-8, and
  cross-file references do not cause invented valid records or cascades presented
  as certain semantic errors.
- Invalid recovered input still fails strict validation and formatter write-back;
  valid-input semantic inventories remain unchanged.
- Adversarial inputs terminate with bounded diagnostics; include a deterministic
  generator or targeted mutations for boundary recovery.
- The recorded before/after examples show user-visible diagnostic improvement,
  independently of internal class names or package layout.

## Out of scope

- Incremental parsing, a complete language server, new grammar, Unicode policy
  changes, or generalized compiler infrastructure.

## Compatibility and affected components

Valid 0.1/0.2 behavior remains unchanged. Document improved invalid-input diagnostics
and incomplete semantic data explicitly. Components: Interpreter.Parser, decode and
source-set validation boundaries, diagnostics, and regression fixtures.

## Completion decision

Keep recovery only where synchronization is reliable. Prefer an explicit incomplete
result to speculative records; split unrelated performance or formatting refactors
and profile before optimizing them.
