# Task TC-1203: Define Import and Reference Contracts

Status: Planned

Roadmap stage: 12

Type: Decision

Depends on: TC-1201

Unlocks: TC-1204, TC-1302, TC-0905

## Question

How can independently compiled artifacts refer to one another with explicit scope,
revision, provenance, and completeness rather than hidden project state?

## Outcome

A reference/import/linking decision record and worked fixture contract sufficient
for the first verification consumer and TC-1204's bounded resolver.

## Work

- Define common reference/provenance/linking meanings at the compiled interface.
  Distinguish those meanings from their encoding in each artifact's source or
  input declaration. Use TC-1103's different source carriers as the first example;
  bindings for other artifact formats remain with their own contract decisions.
- Define import declarations, local resolution roots, dependency selection and
  recorded resolved versions. Compare current-checkout selection with pinned Git
  revisions using two local repositories; remote fetching can remain unsupported.
- Define artifact qualification plus the existing authored element ID, expected
  target kinds, duplicate/ambiguous names, missing targets, and incompatible formats.
- Separate authored references from derived inverse indexes. Preserve the location,
  owner, context, and revision binding of each assertion.
- Separate legitimate relationship cycles from build dependency cycles. Specify
  unresolved-reference preservation, linking passes, and unsupported build cycles.
- Specify incomplete or invalid imports, offline behavior, input changes during a
  build, deterministic ordering, diagnostics, and consumer completeness checks.
- Define revision comparison with TC-0905's concrete staleness question in mind:
  compare Git binding and per-requirement semantic comparison before selecting a
  fingerprint. Document canonicalization, hashing inputs, and version if exposed.

## Acceptance evidence

- Written examples resolve equal IDs in two scopes without changing either
  requirement ID; ambiguous unqualified references fail precisely.
- A table covers comment-only, normative, unrelated, ID, file-move, and imported
  revision changes with expected identity, binding, and rebuild outcomes.
- Missing, incompatible, cyclic, partial, and context-filtered cases have explicit
  expected diagnostics or supported linked results.
- Linking proves resolvability/type compatibility only; a path to a requirement
  does not prove satisfaction or propagate approval.
- A worked requirement/plan example resolves references and retains source
  provenance across TC-1103's different source representations. The linker contract
  requires the selected compiled interfaces, without requiring YAML source or a
  shared source parser for imported artifacts.
- Source remains authoritative; compiled imports and recorded build manifests
  identify their exact inputs and can be regenerated.

## Out of scope

- Network resolution, package registries, machine-generated requirement identity,
  universal type inheritance, arbitrary queries, or domain inference.

## Compatibility and affected components

Current standalone .mreq input selection remains valid. Likely components:
artifact-envelope contracts, explicit project input declarations, source locators,
and a resolver. A digest represents a particular compiled form/revision, changes
with relevant content edits, and stays outside authored requirements.

## Completion decision

Enable TC-0905 and conditionally TC-1204 when local, inspectable imports satisfy
the first workflow. Stop rules that require hidden global identity or a complete
systems model merely to resolve references.

## Planning refinement

Make the compiled integration boundary independent of authoring notation. The
requirements YAML choice does not select import syntax for every artifact type.
Status and dependencies remain unchanged.
