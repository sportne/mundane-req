# Task TC-0303: Publish the Validator Trial Contract

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 3

Type: Decision and documentation

Depends on: TC-0302

Unlocks: TC-0601

## Question

Which validator behaviors is the project prepared to present as the first maintained tool interface?

## Outcome

The repository documents, versions, and identifies a trial release of `mundanereq-validate` without extending language stability promises to accidental CLI details.

## Work

- Document installation, invocation, exit behavior, supported source contract, and diagnostic expectations.
- Separate normative source conformance from provisional command-line behavior.
- Record limitations and unsupported policy checks.
- Tag or otherwise identify the reproducible maintained implementation baseline.
- Update README references away from the validation role of the experiment probe.

## Acceptance evidence

- A new user can validate a clean repository from the documentation.
- Language, tool, and Java API compatibility boundaries are stated separately.
- The native binary remains derived and reproducible.
- The release record links its complete test evidence.

## Out of scope

- Formatter or trace packaging.
- A stable 1.0 tool promise.
- Multi-platform binary distribution without demonstrated users.

## Completion decision

Publish as a trial tool only if its supported behavior and limitations can be stated more simply than the experiment it replaces.

## Result

The [validator trial contract 0.1](../specification/0007-validator-trial-contract-0.1.md)
states the complete supported invocation, selection, diagnostic, and exit
behavior and separates source-language, command-line, and Java compatibility.
The interface is deliberately smaller than the historical experiment probe:
it validates explicit source selections and performs no inventory, formatting,
trace, policy, or interchange work.

`make validator-verify` remains the reproducible evidence gate. The
`validator-trial-0.1` Git tag identifies the reviewed source baseline, while
the executable remains a disposable native build product. The supported
behavior and limitations are sufficiently bounded to publish this as a
maintained trial, without making a stable 1.0 promise.
