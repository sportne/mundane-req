# Task TC-0707: Test Bounded Diagnostic Presentation

Status: Ready

Roadmap stage: 7

Type: Tool-interface experiment

Depends on: TC-0704

Unlocks: A validator diagnostic-presentation decision

## Question

How should an engineer or CI job navigate a large valid set of diagnostics
without hiding errors or changing language conformance?

## Outcome

A focused experiment compares the complete terminal stream with bounded human
presentation and machine-readable output while retaining an explicit way to
obtain every diagnostic.

## Work

- Use the reproducible 1,200-error corpus from Experiment 0014.
- Compare complete text, an explicit limit/summary, and one conventional structured-output shape.
- Exercise local repair, CI attribution, and complete archival use cases.
- Keep diagnostic identity and source coordinates stable across presentations.
- Select at most one bounded validator-interface change or defer it.

## Acceptance evidence

- No error is silently discarded.
- Truncation or summarization is explicit and reports omitted counts.
- Ordinary text remains sufficient for the common small-error case.
- Structured output does not become authoritative requirement state.

## Out of scope

- A generalized reporting framework.
- Persistent diagnostic storage.
- Changing source-language validity.

## Completion decision

Add a focused output mode only if it materially improves the recorded workflow
without complicating the normal terminal interface.
