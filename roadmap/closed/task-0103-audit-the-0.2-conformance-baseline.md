# Task TC-0103: Audit the 0.2 Conformance Baseline

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 1

Type: Conformance review

Depends on: TC-0101 and TC-0102

Unlocks: TC-0104

## Question

Does the maintained 0.2 corpus cover the contract well enough to protect the first implementation refactoring?

## Outcome

A written audit maps normative rule areas to positive or negative evidence and records deliberate coverage gaps.

## Work

- Map physical source, discovery, record grammar, fields, prose, math, comments, identity, and relationships to fixtures or tests.
- Confirm comments remain absent from semantic inventories and ReqIF output.
- Identify accidental probe CLI behavior that is not part of language conformance.
- Classify uncovered cases as required before refactoring, useful later, or intentionally outside the fixture suite.
- Update conformance documentation where expected behavior is implicit.

## Acceptance evidence

- The audit is committed as a research or conformance record.
- Every normative rule area has evidence or an explicit gap disposition.
- No experimental inventory or diagnostic wording is accidentally declared normative.
- Both contract versions remain reproducible from their existing tags.

## Out of scope

- Attempting exhaustive combinatorial grammar testing.
- Defining the future tool CLI.
- Promoting the probe to maintained architecture.

## Completion decision

Proceed only if the audit finds no unresolved ambiguity that could make two conforming implementations assign different semantic values.

## Result

[Research 0010](../../research/0010-source-0.2-conformance-audit.md) maps every
normative rule area to fixtures, probe tests, adjacent-consumer evidence, or
an explicit gap disposition. It confirms comments are absent from both the
semantic inventory and derived ReqIF and separates normative interpretation
from accidental probe CLI, inventory, diagnostic-string, and Java API
behavior.

No unresolved semantic ambiguity was found. The audit identifies a required
preservation set for TC-0204, seven useful cross-implementation cases that do
not block extraction, and concerns intentionally outside source conformance.
The original 0.1 and 0.2 annotated contract tags remain unchanged and
reproducible.
