# Task TC-1402: Report CLI Output Failures Consistently

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 14

Type: Implementation and verification

Depends on: none

Unlocks: TC-1504

## Question

How can each CLI avoid reporting successful completion when required command
output or diagnostics could not be delivered?

## Outcome

Validator, formatter, and trace report output failures consistently while
preserving their independent command interfaces.

## Work

- Reproduce ValidatorMain's unchecked PrintStream output for help, version, and
  successful validation. Reuse formatter/trace finishOutput behavior where applicable.
- Audit stdout and stderr completion paths, including diagnostic-only failures;
  decide precedence when source nonconformance and diagnostic delivery both fail.
- Specify broken-pipe handling, a stream failing after a prefix, flush failure,
  already-closed streams, and the case where both streams are unusable.
- Extend existing output-failure tests rather than duplicating covered formatter
  and trace cases; make the selected behavior usable by future artifact emitters.

## Acceptance evidence

- Injected output/flush failures cannot yield a success exit from any tested
  help/version/normal-output path; operational delivery failures use documented exits.
- Partial-write and diagnostic-stream cases assert exit behavior and available
  fallback reporting without requiring writing to an already failed stream.
- A process-level JVM/native check exercises a closed pipe where supported and
  records the chosen platform behavior.
- Existing successful output and source-versus-input failure distinctions remain
  verified; tests demonstrate the validator regression before its repair.

## Out of scope

- New output formats, refactoring every CLI into one application, or changing
  language validity to accommodate presentation failures.

## Compatibility and affected components

Tighten current false-success behavior with explicit trial-contract notes.
Components: the three CLI classes, focused tests, contracts, and future shared
output helpers only where they prevent inconsistent error handling.

## Completion decision

Close when every required output path has a verifiable completion policy. Record
platform-specific pipe limitations rather than assuming an in-memory failing
stream proves all native behavior.

## Completion evidence and decision

Completed 2026-09-05 in the requirements YAML batch.

All four maintained commands check stdout/stderr completion, including early
returns and source diagnostics. Partial, flush, closed and both-stream failures
return non-success; JVM/native descriptor and broken-pipe checks pass. The recorded
pre-fix validator false-success case now returns operational failure.

The [batch verification](../../research/0035-yaml-requirements-batch-verification.md)
records full make verify, golden/native checks and limitations. The
[contract decision](../../research/0034-yaml-requirements-contract-decision.md),
[source contract](../../specification/0010-requirements-yaml-0.3.md),
[command addendum](../../specification/0011-tool-safety-and-yaml-commands.md), and
[reproducible regression evidence](../../experiments/0026-yaml-requirements-batch/README.md)
provide the acceptance artifacts. Historical contracts remain preserved; other
artifact authoring formats and future attribute scope remain independent decisions.
