# Task TC-1109: Migrate YAML Examples and Conformance Material

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 11

Type: Tooling and testing

Depends on: TC-1107, TC-1108

Unlocks: documented YAML authoring and reproducible contributor workflows

## Question

A parser alone leaves authors with custom examples and no safe way to carry their
requirements into the selected YAML profile.

## Outcome

A bounded migration tool, representative converted examples and conformance/docs
make the selected authoring workflow reviewable and reproducible.

## Work

- Implement dry-run/separate-output conversion under TC-1106's migration contract,
  preserving IDs, optional values, paragraphs/math, references and documented
  comment placement; reject unsupported cases rather than guessing.
- Compare whole-source-set semantics before/after conversion and exercise output
  collisions, interruption and invalid input without overwriting originals blindly.
- Convert selected maintained examples and dogfooding inputs only after reviewing
  their paired semantic/comment evidence; update selection manifests deliberately.
- Publish language-reference examples, migration notes and explicit selectors.
  Preserve historical versioned fixtures and reproduction instructions.
- Add golden and bounded generated/mutated edge cases for conversion, formatting,
  no-schema projects and temporary coexistence only if selected.

## Acceptance evidence

- Reproducible conversion records show unchanged authored IDs, semantic values and
  links; every supported comment position has a checked expectation.
- One/many-record and split/combined-file projects pass source-set equivalence and
  formatter checks; deliberate conversion failures leave original input intact.
- Current documentation commands execute against maintained tools. Conformance
  inventories include new source sets without disguising invalid inputs.
- Historical 0.1/0.2 evidence remains reproducible; migration/coexistence behavior
  and any retirement conditions match TC-1106. Authoritative source is unambiguous.
- The repository verification command passes with recorded environment and results.

## Out of scope

No automatic migration of external user projects, new attribute semantics,
permanent second authoring system or release work.

## Compatibility, affected components and completion decision

Likely components: migration executable/experiment promoted by decision, examples,
conformance fixtures/manifests, source reference and contributor documentation.
Stop on altered normative text, lost comments or unresolved source authority; keep
conversion reviewable and preserve originals until verified.

## Completion evidence and decision

Completed 2026-09-05 in the requirements YAML batch.

Implemented the separately built native migration utility with dry-run and new-
directory output, whole-set equality before writes, documented header comment
relocation and no-overwrite/recovery behavior. Converted 120 requirements across
three corpora with 11 files; authoring/migration docs and conformance are maintained.

The [batch verification](../../research/0035-yaml-requirements-batch-verification.md)
records full make verify, golden/native checks and limitations. The
[contract decision](../../research/0034-yaml-requirements-contract-decision.md),
[source contract](../../specification/0010-requirements-yaml-0.3.md),
[command addendum](../../specification/0011-tool-safety-and-yaml-commands.md), and
[reproducible regression evidence](../../experiments/0026-yaml-requirements-batch/README.md)
provide the acceptance artifacts. Historical contracts remain preserved; other
artifact authoring formats and future attribute scope remain independent decisions.
