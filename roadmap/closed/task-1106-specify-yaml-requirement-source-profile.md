# Task TC-1106: Specify the YAML Requirement Source Profile

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 11

Type: Design

Depends on: TC-1105

Unlocks: TC-1107, TC-1302

## Question

The comparison proves a bounded YAML representation but leaves scalar styles,
source selection and complete semantic edge cases unresolved. A written source
contract prevents library defaults from silently defining requirements.

## Outcome

A reviewed requirements specification defines the requirement model, its YAML
representation, a pinned machine-readable structural schema, and semantic rules
beyond that schema. It enables implementation without changing requirement
identity or inventing attribute scope. Its authoring-format scope is requirements
only; other artifact representations remain independent decisions.

## Work

- Apply every clause in Experiment 0025's specification outline. Settle YAML
  version/Core resolution, schema dialect, key types, record shape and scalar
  shorthand; decide quoted/block text requirements using the hash-loss finding.
- Specify physical/decoded characters, folded/literal/chomping behavior, ordered
  paragraphs/math, duplicates, null/empty, aliases/tags/directives/streams and
  resource limits with valid/invalid examples.
- Select explicit source-format/version identifiers, extension/discovery and
  standalone-file behavior. State mixed-input and temporary migration policies.
- Assign structural constraints, field/relationship meanings, domain/source-set
  rules and diagnostic obligations explicit authoritative homes in the schema and
  specification. State precedence and consistency checks. Preserve current field
  meanings and human IDs; leave typed project attributes to TC-1301/TC-1302.
  Record alternatives and intentional compatibility changes.

## Acceptance evidence

- A clause-by-clause disposition and reviewable normative successor define every
  current semantic field and every experimental failure case; no default library
  setting substitutes for a rule.
- Examples cover one/many records, multiple files, quoting hazards, paragraph/math
  boundaries, comments, invalid input and format/version conflicts.
- The schema and prose agree; a rule map identifies their respective authority
  and conformance examples check consistency. Field meanings, reference direction,
  source-set validity and source-coordinate conventions are explicit. Historical
  0.1/0.2 contracts retain their original authority.
- The scope statement confines this YAML profile to requirements. Verification
  plans, safety assessments, BOMs and other artifacts inherit no authoring format,
  schema or YAML parser requirement from this specification.
- Migration notes specify selectors, temporary coexistence if needed, checks and
  retirement conditions without committing to permanent dual authoring.

## Out of scope

No production parser/formatter changes, corpus conversion, new attributes, or
long-term language-stability promise.

## Compatibility, affected components and completion decision

Likely components: source specification, conformance examples, schema and command
contracts. This is a breaking surface-syntax proposal; retain current behavior
until successor implementation and migration checks. Stop if an existing semantic
case cannot be represented without loss; revise the profile/decision explicitly.

## Planning refinement

Make the requirements model, representation, structural schema and semantic rules
explicit deliverables, with one authoritative home per rule. Scope these decisions
to requirements; integration with other artifacts uses their separately selected
contracts. Status and dependencies remain unchanged.


## Completion evidence and decision

Completed 2026-09-05 in the requirements YAML batch.

Selected mundanereq-yaml-0.3 with normative structural schema, explicit YAML
profile/domain rules, selectors, migration policy and source 0.2 clause disposition.
The independent schema check verifies consistency with maintained conformance cases.

The [batch verification](../../research/0035-yaml-requirements-batch-verification.md)
records full make verify, golden/native checks and limitations. The
[contract decision](../../research/0034-yaml-requirements-contract-decision.md),
[source contract](../../specification/0010-requirements-yaml-0.3.md),
[command addendum](../../specification/0011-tool-safety-and-yaml-commands.md), and
[reproducible regression evidence](../../experiments/0026-yaml-requirements-batch/README.md)
provide the acceptance artifacts. Historical contracts remain preserved; other
artifact authoring formats and future attribute scope remain independent decisions.
