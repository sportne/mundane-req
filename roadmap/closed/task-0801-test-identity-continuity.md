# Task TC-0801: Test Identity Continuity

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 8

Type: Model-pressure experiment

Depends on: TC-0603 and a workflow requiring ID correction

Unlocks: A requirement identity decision and TC-1001

## Question

When a human-facing ID is corrected, what evidence is required to distinguish continuity from requirement replacement across baselines and consumers?

## Outcome

A focused experiment compares Git-only atomic correction, explicit continuity assertions, and separate durable identity without presuming hidden IDs.

## Work

- Create adjacent baselines containing a realistic ID correction and updated internal links.
- Test history, trace queries, baseline comparison, and ReqIF mapping.
- Include at least one stale external or companion-artifact reference.
- Compare ordinary diffs and consumer repair behavior for each candidate model.
- Record whether provenance can identify continuity without becoming identity.

## Acceptance evidence

- Each alternative is exercised on the same scenario.
- The experiment distinguishes human intent from what source snapshots semantically assert.
- Costs to standalone readability and interchange are explicit.
- No identity mechanism is selected merely because a database-oriented tool uses it.

## Out of scope

- General aliasing or rename syntax.
- Cross-repository package identity.
- Automatic fuzzy identity matching.

## Completion decision

Retain ID-only identity unless a demonstrated consumer cannot preserve necessary continuity through atomic source and Git history. If new identity is selected, specify its authority and visibility explicitly.

Completed on 2026-08-29. [Experiment 0016](../../experiments/0016-identity-continuity/README.md)
compares the same correction under Git-only replacement, an explicit continuity
assertion, and a durable opaque identity. Atomic internal links and ordinary
diffs are sufficient. Additional identity helps external synchronization only
when it was made authoritative and shared before the correction.

Retain the human-facing ID as the provisional sole 0.2 snapshot identity for
this bounded scenario. Reopen for any independently baselined consumer that
demonstrates a need for pre-exchanged cross-baseline identity.
