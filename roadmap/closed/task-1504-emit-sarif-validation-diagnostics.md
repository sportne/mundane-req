# Task TC-1504: Emit SARIF Validation Diagnostics

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 15

Type: Implementation and verification

Depends on: TC-1201, TC-1402, TC-1403

Unlocks: follow-up work selected by the completion decision

## Question

How can validation diagnostics be consumed by code-review and editor tools without
scraping the human-readable CLI output?

## Outcome

An explicit SARIF output mode represents the selected diagnostic contract with
correct ranges, rule identifiers, severity, and failure behavior.

## Work

- Select and document the SARIF specification/schema version and CLI output mode;
  map TC-1201's diagnostic rules and completeness states.
- Define artifact URIs, path roots, Unicode coordinate conversion, range endpoints,
  severity mapping, tool metadata, and deterministic multi-file ordering.
- Handle malformed source, input-selection failure, partial recovery, no findings,
  unknown options, closed output, partial writes, and flush failure.
- Preserve the default human-readable validator interface; document exits separately
  from SARIF emission success.

## Acceptance evidence

- Golden output validates against the selected checked-in or reproducibly obtained
  SARIF schema, including clean, multi-file, and invalid-input examples.
- Fixtures verify exact source ranges with non-ASCII text and supplementary Unicode
  characters, stable rule IDs, severity mapping, and portable path encoding.
- Malformed source remains a failed validation even if a valid report was emitted;
  output failures never yield success.
- A bounded fixture consumer or available viewer demonstrates source navigation;
  record exact consumer/version if an external integration is exercised.
- Human-readable default output and existing source validity checks remain covered.

## Out of scope

- Forge upload automation, a complete language server, new Unicode validity policy,
  or representing successful report generation as successful validation.

## Compatibility and affected components

Present problem: integrations otherwise parse plain diagnostic strings.
Components: Diagnostic/source spans, validator output selection, SARIF serializer,
focused tests and CLI documentation. Rule evolution follows the experimental
compatibility policy rather than silently changing rule meanings.

## Completion decision

Accept only schema-valid, source-accurate reports with tested failure behavior.
If current locations cannot support truthful ranges, preserve accurate points
temporarily with an explicit contract decision instead of inventing spans.

## Planning refinement

Cover YAML 0.3 and retained custom source. The parser supplies accurate points,
so the selected contract uses start positions without invented end ranges. Test
OS stderr closure on an actual diagnostic write; quiet SARIF emission does not
write that descriptor. Closed Java streams and output-prefix/flush failures have
separate checks. The OASIS schema is a checked-in test dependency only.

## Completion evidence

Implemented the explicit SARIF mode under [Contract 0017](../../specification/0017-sarif-validation-output.md). [Research 0049](../../research/0049-sarif-diagnostics-verification.md) records six OASIS-schema goldens, exact Unicode/path navigation, JVM/native agreement, stream-failure behavior, version metadata, and native package verification. Seventeen JVM groups passed. Point regions preserve truthful locations; no end spans or external-editor compatibility are invented.
