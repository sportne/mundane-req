# Task TC-0401: Run the Formatting Policy Experiment

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 4

Type: Experiment and decision

Depends on: TC-0203

Unlocks: TC-0402

## Question

Which minimum canonicalization rules reduce diff noise without erasing useful source structure or changing semantics?

## Outcome

A recorded comparison selects or rejects conservative structural formatting, prose reflow, line-ending normalization, and source-order policies.

## Work

- Create varied but valid fixtures covering wrapping, blank lines, CRLF, comments, multiple records, and opaque LaTeX payloads.
- Compare a conservative policy with at least one prose-reflow alternative.
- Inspect every candidate rewrite using ordinary unified and word-level Git diffs.
- Define expected handling of record order, relationship order, comments, final line endings, and math payloads.
- Select check, standard-output, and possible in-place operating modes.

## Acceptance evidence

- The experiment records concrete before-and-after fixtures and diff observations.
- Every selected rewrite has a semantic-preservation argument.
- Comment behavior does not invent semantic attachment.
- Opaque math payload preservation is explicit.
- Rejected formatting choices and their reasons are retained.

## Out of scope

- Implementing the formatter.
- Repairing invalid source.
- Sorting requirements into a document view.
- Styling rendered output.

## Completion decision

Select the smallest policy that creates material consistency. If only a narrow subset is clearly safe, ship a narrow formatter rather than expanding comment or source semantics.

## Result

[Experiment 0008](../../experiments/0008-formatting-policy/README.md) compares a
conservative structural policy with prose reflow over conforming source that
combines CRLF, blank-line variation, comments, multiple records, repeated
relationships, wrapped prose, and opaque LaTeX.

Both candidates preserve the semantic inventory, but prose reflow creates
unrelated unified-diff churn and requires substantially more interpretation.
The selected first policy therefore normalizes line endings to LF and collapses
comment-free inter-record blank-line runs to exactly one line. It preserves
all nonblank text and order and leaves every other blank line unchanged. Check,
context-aware single-file standard-output, and explicit per-file safe-replacement
write modes are selected.

This is the smallest policy found to provide material consistency without
inventing comment attachment, prose-width, ordering, or math semantics.
