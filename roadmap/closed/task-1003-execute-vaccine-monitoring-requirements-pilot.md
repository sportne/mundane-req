# Task TC-1003: Execute a Vaccine-Monitoring Requirements Pilot

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 10

Type: Trial

Depends on: TC-1002

Unlocks: TC-0905 and a renewed source 1.0 readiness assessment

## Question

Can the provisional requirement model, ordinary Git workflow, maintained native
tools, and provisional companion-artifact decisions support a realistic,
end-to-end formal-traceability workflow without language expansion?

## Outcome

A bounded hypothetical product is taken from authoritative public source
material through context definition, requirements development, allocation,
decomposition, validation, formatting, trace analysis, verification planning,
safety assessment, a Git-identifiable baseline, one controlled change, and a
second baseline. The resulting assessment identifies model strengths, friction,
and justified next work.

## Work

- Baseline exact public source documents and define stakeholders, product
  boundary, operational contexts, assumptions, and exclusions.
- Author stakeholder, system, and allocated lower-level requirements with
  rationale, provenance, and decomposition relationships.
- Exercise the validator, formatter, and trace executables independently.
- Represent source-set scope, verification planning, and contextual safety
  assessment in human-readable companion artifacts without standardizing their
  experimental carriers.
- Review and baseline the initial requirement set in Git.
- Process one controlled change through impact analysis, source edits,
  validation, review, and rebaselining.
- Assess whether observed information belongs in requirement records,
  relationships, companion artifacts, project policy, Git/forge workflow, or
  another focused tool.

## Acceptance evidence

- Every authoritative input has an identifier, version or revision, locator,
  role, and retrieval date.
- The source remains directly readable, and ordinary diffs expose the
  controlled change.
- Both requirement baselines conform to `mundanereq-source-0.2` and pass the
  formatter check.
- Representative parent, child, higher-level, and impact queries are recorded.
- Verification and assessment assertions identify the exact requirement
  baseline to which they apply.
- The trial records uncovered requirements, stale companion data, ambiguous
  ownership, and tooling gaps rather than silently resolving them.
- The repository-wide verification gate passes at completion.

## Out of scope

- Product implementation, simulation, qualification, certification, or a claim
  that the hypothetical system complies with WHO or CDC guidance.
- External participants, outreach, or independent-human usability evidence.
- Standardizing companion-file syntax or adding source-language features.
- Exhaustively transcribing every clause in the source documents.

## Completion decision

Retain the existing model where the workflow is understandable with modest
companion artifacts. Create narrowly framed follow-up work only for concrete
friction observed in the pilot. Do not publish source 1.0 solely because this
self-executed pilot succeeds.

Completed on 2026-08-30. Experiment 0024 established two tagged requirement
baselines, executed CR-001, retained the source language unchanged, and selected
the bounded verification-analyzer contract experiment in TC-0905. Source 1.0
remains deferred because the self-executed pilot does not provide independent-
human evidence. The final GraalVM `make verify` gate passes with the pilot work
product included in the maintained 30-source-set, 64-file formatter matrix.
