# Task TC-1108: Format YAML Source Without Content Loss

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 11

Type: Implementation

Depends on: TC-1107

Unlocks: TC-1109

## Question

Generic YAML emitters in Experiment 0025 lost comments; node emission also failed
idempotence. Authoritative source needs a deliberately bounded formatter.

## Outcome

A specified, conservative YAML formatting path preserves semantic values and
source comments while reporting write/output failures accurately.

## Work

- Select the smallest transformations justified by authoring needs, beginning
  with the proven line-ending policy. Broader normalization needs new evidence.
- Retain concrete source/comments and validate the full selected source set before
  rewriting. Do not serialize semantic objects as a substitute for source editing.
- Integrate formatter check/write modes and current safety behavior. Reconcile
  snapshot protection and output failures with TC-1401/TC-1402 without duplicating
  their independent work or claiming their future fixes are already present.
- Add inline/boundary comments, quoted values, folded/literal scalars and math
  payloads to preservation fixtures, including the failed emitter examples.

## Acceptance evidence

- Parse-format-parse equality, exact comment preservation under the documented
  policy and byte idempotence pass for every supported transformation.
- Invalid input does not produce a claimed successful rewrite. Tests cover CRLF,
  source changes, partial multi-file outcomes and failing output/write paths under
  the adopted safety contract; any remaining races are explicitly documented.
- Check and write modes report deterministic results on JVM/native. The formatter
  contract lists supported transformations and deliberate non-transformations.

## Out of scope

No general YAML pretty-printer, arbitrary field sorting, source migration utility,
new attributes or unrelated formatter cleanup.

## Compatibility, affected components and completion decision

Likely components: concrete source representation, SourceFormatter, formatter CLI,
fixtures and formatter contract. Current custom formatting stays available according
to TC-1106's compatibility policy. Stop rather than rewrite when source/comment
fidelity cannot be demonstrated; a narrower formatter is an acceptable outcome.

## Completion evidence and decision

Completed 2026-09-05 in the requirements YAML batch.

Implemented text-preserving CRLF normalization under YAML mode with complete
source-set validation and the shared snapshot/output safety behavior. Hand-authored
comments, folded prose, literal math and idempotence pass on JVM/native.

The [batch verification](../../research/0035-yaml-requirements-batch-verification.md)
records full make verify, golden/native checks and limitations. The
[contract decision](../../research/0034-yaml-requirements-contract-decision.md),
[source contract](../../specification/0010-requirements-yaml-0.3.md),
[command addendum](../../specification/0011-tool-safety-and-yaml-commands.md), and
[reproducible regression evidence](../../experiments/0026-yaml-requirements-batch/README.md)
provide the acceptance artifacts. Historical contracts remain preserved; other
artifact authoring formats and future attribute scope remain independent decisions.
