# Task TC-1201: Define Requirement Semantic Output

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 12

Type: Decision

Depends on: TC-1103, TC-1502

Unlocks: TC-1202, TC-1203, TC-1504

## Question

What information must requirements publish so a consumer can use their semantics
and diagnostics without depending on Interpreter's private representation?

## Outcome

A written, versioned compiled-output contract, preferably JSON, with worked
examples and golden expectations for current source and future extensions.

## Work

- Specify requirement/content fields, optional versus absent values, decomposition,
  opaque math, human IDs, deterministic ordering, and a versioned common envelope
  limited to TC-1103's demonstrated consumer.
- Retain requirement, field, and relationship source ranges separately from
  normative values; define coordinate units, end positions, and path normalization.
- Specify artifact kind, source-contract version, compiler version, source
  provenance, references, and completeness state using TC-1502's distinct domains.
- Define diagnostics, stable rule meanings, severities, invalid input, partial
  editor information, unknown format versions, and stream/exit behavior.
- Record how typed attributes could be added after TC-1302, without publishing
  guessed syntax or an untyped extension bag.
- Distinguish deterministic semantic payload from revision provenance. Specify
  exactly which comparisons ignore paths, comments, or unrelated source edits.

## Acceptance evidence

- A decision and format reference cover valid multi-file input, Unicode ranges,
  invalid input, duplicate IDs, unresolved references, and an unknown version.
- Golden examples account for every current Requirement field and diagnostic
  location; normalizedInventory is explicitly treated as a test utility.
- A table classifies additive versus breaking output changes, with migration and
  consumer rejection behavior during the experimental series.
- The contract tells a consumer when analysis is permitted and how source can be
  located without treating compiled JSON as an authoring format.

## Out of scope

- Implementing serialization, freezing Java APIs, a universal artifact metamodel,
  or adding custom attributes before their design decision.

## Compatibility and affected components

Retain existing source/CLI contracts. Likely components: Interpreter.Result,
Requirement, Diagnostic and retained locations; source spans; a new output contract.
Requirement IDs remain authored identities. Digests, if selected for revision
comparison, identify the documented compiled form, change with relevant edits, and
do not enter authored .mreq files.

## Completion decision

Enable TC-1202 and TC-1203 only when the first verification consumer can interpret
the examples without undocumented parser details. Defer fields with no consumer;
revise any proposal that mixes source trivia with normative requirement content.

## Completion evidence

Completed by [Research 0040](../../research/0040-requirement-semantic-output-decision.md), [semantic output 0.1](../../specification/0012-requirement-semantic-output-0.1.md), the diagnostic rule catalog and worked JSON/source fixtures. A parser-independent consumer accepted the valid multi-file case and rejected invalid, duplicate, dangling and unknown-format cases. TC-1202 must now verify exact emitter bytes and retained spans; TC-1202 and TC-1203 are Ready.
