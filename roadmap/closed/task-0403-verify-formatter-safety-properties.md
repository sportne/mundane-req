# Task TC-0403: Verify Formatter Safety Properties

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 4

Type: Verification

Depends on: TC-0402

Unlocks: TC-0404

## Question

Does formatting remain semantically preserving, idempotent, comment-preserving, and reviewable over all maintained source?

## Outcome

Automated property checks and recorded Git-diff reviews establish the formatter's safety boundary.

## Work

- Compare semantic inventories before and after formatting every valid fixture and corpus.
- Format outputs twice and require byte-identical second results.
- Verify comment text and relative order across every legal placement.
- Verify opaque math payloads under multiline and special-character cases.
- Exercise LF/CRLF and standard-output, check, and in-place modes.
- Review representative large rewrites through ordinary Git diffs.

## Acceptance evidence

- Semantic equality holds for every valid maintained corpus.
- Idempotence holds byte-for-byte.
- No comment or math payload is lost or reinterpreted.
- Check mode returns documented exit behavior.
- JVM and native-image results agree.

## Out of scope

- Proving aesthetic preference.
- Formatting invalid or future language versions.
- Semantic equivalence of LaTeX expressions.

## Completion decision

Any semantic change, non-idempotence, or unexplained comment movement blocks publication. Narrow the formatting contract before adding recovery machinery.

## Result

[Research 0015](../../research/0015-formatter-verification.md) records the
automated property matrix and ordinary Git-diff review. Nine maintained source
sets spanning both language versions, both layout experiments, both sustained
corpora, CRLF/LF, comments, prose, and multiline math retain equal requirement
and relationship semantics after formatting and produce byte-identical second
results.

All nonblank physical text, comment order, and opaque math lines are compared
exactly. Standard-output, check, write, invalid-input, and context-input results
agree between the JVM and no-fallback native executable. Existing focused tests
cover output and replacement failures, permission bits, cleanup, and
prevalidation.

No semantic change, non-idempotence, comment movement, math rewrite, or
JVM/native disagreement was found. Advance the unchanged two-rule formatter to
a trial contract.
