# Task TC-0204: Port Tests and Prove Native Tool Boundaries

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 2

Type: Implementation and architecture verification

Depends on: TC-0203

Unlocks: TC-0301, TC-0402, and TC-0502

## Question

Does the shared foundation preserve earned behavior while supporting three genuinely separate native executables?

## Outcome

Existing regression evidence runs against maintained code, and minimal validator, formatter, and trace entry points build as independent native images.

## Work

- Port semantic inventory, invalid-source, discovery, comment, math, and relationship tests.
- Compare maintained results with the historical probe over every project corpus.
- Add minimal executable entry points without implementing later card scope.
- Build each entry point separately with GraalVM Native Image.
- Verify no executable calls another executable at runtime.

## Acceptance evidence

- All ported JVM tests pass.
- All three native images build without fallback mode.
- Each executable can be removed without preventing the other two from starting.
- Historical experiments remain reproducible.
- Shared code contains no speculative plugin or metamodel layer.

## Out of scope

- Final CLI design.
- Formatter or trace feature implementation.
- Distribution packaging.

## Completion decision

Proceed to product tools only if shared behavior remains identical and the separate native boundaries do not require duplicated parsing.

## Result

[Research 0013](../../research/0013-maintained-interpreter-migration-closeout.md)
records byte-identical maintained/probe inventories over all six valid project
corpora and the transfer of twelve audited interpreter test groups. The three
temporary executable boundaries build separately with GraalVM Native Image
without fallback, start independently, and contain no validator, formatter, or
trace behavior ahead of their product cards. Stage 2 can therefore close
without retaining the historical probe in the maintained build.
