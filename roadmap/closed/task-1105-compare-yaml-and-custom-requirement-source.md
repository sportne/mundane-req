# Task TC-1105: Compare YAML and Custom Requirement Source

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 11

Type: Experiment and decision

Depends on: none

Unlocks: TC-1103 and a requirements-specification representation decision

## Question

Does the custom requirement syntax provide enough authoring and tooling benefit
to justify its maintenance cost, or should the requirements specification define
a YAML-compatible representation with an explicit schema and domain rules?

## Outcome

A bounded comparison and written decision recommend retaining custom syntax,
adopting a specified YAML profile, or deferring the choice for a named unresolved
case. The decision includes the specification and migration work each option
requires, without changing the current normative contract during this experiment.

## Work

- Reuse the prior representation research, but address its evidence gap: YAML was
  discussed as prior art rather than exercised in the original candidate slate.
- Select a small fixed corpus of roughly 8–12 requirements from existing pilot,
  prose/math, and comment fixtures. Encode the same semantic model in current
  .mreq syntax and one documented YAML candidate; record any unsupported case.
- Define the candidate YAML version, top-level shape, schema mechanism, and
  supported subset. Exercise a requirements list with multiple records per file
  and a single-record file; assess document-stream alternatives only if needed.
  The candidate must parse with an ordinary conforming YAML parser without
  custom preprocessing that merely makes the notation resemble YAML.
- Map all current fields and ordered prose/math blocks explicitly. Specify scalar
  typing, literal/folded text and trailing-newline behavior, quoting, comments,
  absent/null/empty values, duplicate/unknown keys, and aliases/tags. Distinguish
  structural schema checks from domain rules such as cross-file ID uniqueness
  and reference resolution; do not silently discard duplicate keys before checking.
- Perform matched authoring, wrapping, relationship-edit, move, split, formatting,
  and Git conflict tasks. Include colons, hashes, numeric/boolean-looking text,
  Unicode, malformed indentation, and mathematical payloads. Keep IDs authored
  and independent of filenames, record order, and YAML nesting.
- Compare source readability, diagnostic locations/recovery, comment and content
  preservation, semantic equivalence, and formatter behavior. Evaluate existing
  parser/schema/editor facilities and remaining custom work, including library
  licensing and Java 21/GraalVM compatibility. Label estimates and untested
  integrations explicitly; authored inspection is not independent usability evidence.
- Evaluate project attributes with clearly labeled hypothetical examples, without
  selecting their scope or bypassing TC-1301/TC-1302. Both representations must
  be able to target the same syntax-independent compiled requirement model.

## Acceptance evidence

- Checked-in paired fixtures, a field/content mapping, exact parser versions,
  reproducible comparison commands, and expected valid/invalid outcomes cover
  the selected corpus. A YAML reader accepts the candidate files as written.
- Valid pairs have equal normalized requirement semantics, including IDs, links,
  optional values, prose and opaque math. Any intentional mismatch is explained;
  comments are assessed separately as source-preservation information.
- Matched edit/conflict examples and formatter round-trip/idempotence checks show
  concrete advantages and failures for each representation. Report syntax/schema
  failures separately from requirements-domain failures with source locations.
- A tradeoff table separates demonstrated authoring/tooling results from expected
  maintenance savings; existing parser investment alone does not decide the result.
- A clause-level specification outline identifies what a YAML-based successor
  would replace, retain, and delegate to YAML/schema rules. It covers multi-file
  selection, diagnostics, conformance, extensions, and remaining semantic validation.
- The decision addresses existing .mreq files, filename/extension conventions,
  explicit format/version selection, migration tooling and semantic checks,
  historical fixtures, and whether any coexistence is temporary. It does not
  silently commit to maintaining two permanent authoring formats.
- If YAML is selected, identify bounded successor cards for specification/schema,
  parser/validator/formatter adaptation, migration, and conformance documentation.
  Retaining custom syntax must identify the concrete benefit demonstrated by the
  comparison; deferral must name the missing evidence and a bounded next check.

## Out of scope

- Rewriting the normative specification now, converting maintained authoring
  corpora in place, replacing production parsers, or implementing new attributes.
- Changing the requirement semantic model to favor either syntax, introducing
  machine-generated identities, or treating compiled JSON as authoritative source.
- A broad serialization-format survey or a requirement to invent a new language
  for each artifact type.

## Compatibility and affected components

Current source 0.1/0.2 contracts and command behavior remain unchanged during the
experiment. Likely later components are the source specification, conformance
fixtures, Interpreter, lossless source representation, formatter, source discovery,
editor integration, and migration documentation. Compilation/linking remains
possible with either authoring syntax. Attribute definitions remain explicit,
typed, checked-in source under their separately selected contract.

## Completion decision

Choose based on semantic fidelity, practical authoring, and the demonstrated
maintenance burden. Narrow a YAML profile that introduces avoidable ambiguity;
reject silent coercion, comment loss during claimed lossless rewriting, or
unexplained normative-text changes. Record the representation decision before
TC-1103 settles the compilation experiment's source adapters. Implementation and
normative specification changes require the resulting successor work.

## Completion evidence and decision

Completed the bounded comparison in [Experiment 0025](../../experiments/0025-yaml-source-comparison/README.md)
and recorded [Research 0033](../../research/0033-yaml-source-representation-decision.md).
Select a constrained YAML target through TC-1106–TC-1109; current normative and
production behavior remains unchanged. Eleven paired records, 28 pressure cases,
12 workflow outcomes and 43 JVM/native parser/emitter comparisons are recorded.
The maintained make verify suite and experimental golden replay passed.

Rich Java emitters lost comments; the conservative text-preserving path passed.
Native schema/domain integration and editor behavior remain untested and are not
claimed as completed work. TC-1103 still awaits TC-1102. TC-1302 additionally
requires TC-1106's final profile; attribute scope remains independently decided.

## Planning refinement

The comparison selected YAML as a future specification direction and creates four
bounded successors for specification, interpretation, formatting and migration.
No requirement source files or normative contracts were converted in this task.
