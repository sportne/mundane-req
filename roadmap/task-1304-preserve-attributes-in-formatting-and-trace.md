# Task TC-1304: Preserve Attributes in Formatting and Trace

Status: Planned

Roadmap stage: 13

Type: Implementation

Depends on: TC-1302, TC-1303

Unlocks: TC-1308

## Question

After schema validation exists, the current formatter and trace still cannot
process the opted-in source profile safely. A schema change during write-back could
invalidate the interpretation used to authorize a write.

## Outcome

Formatting preserves authored attributes/comments and detects intervening schema
changes; trace validates attributes while retaining its existing graph meanings.

## Work

- Add explicit schema selection to formatter/trace using the shared validated snapshots; document each command's options and existing exit classes.
- Keep YAML formatting limited to CRLF normalization. Preserve authored attribute order, comments, quotes, indentation, prose and opaque math. Never rewrite the JSON declaration.
- Recheck declaration bytes and available file identity before each replacement alongside requirement snapshots; retain existing completed/remaining-file reporting and documented final-check race.
- Validate all selected attributes before trace or formatting; attributes contribute no hidden edges. Keep independent tool builds and source modes.
- Add format-check/write, failure, comment/Unicode, schema-edit, source-edit and trace regressions.

## Acceptance evidence

- Golden before/after bytes differ only by permitted line-ending normalization, including comments inside/around attribute mappings; a second format produces identical bytes and parse-format-parse values/definitions agree.
- Missing/invalid schemas or attribute values cause no writes or usable trace result. Injected edits between read and replacement survive; partial multi-file outcomes identify exactly completed/remaining paths.
- Existing decomposition queries return equivalent results for equal built-in models with or without valid annotations; references are neither added nor hidden by text values.
- Actual JVM/native commands cover standalone selection, output failure and source/schema changes; record tests and authoritative verification in a completion report.

## Out of scope

- Canonical key sorting in authored YAML, JSON schema formatting, a new trace policy, filesystem transactions, editor integration.

## Compatibility and affected components

New source/option support is explicit; old source/CLI behavior and requirement IDs
remain unchanged. Likely components: FormatterMain, TraceMain, shared source
selection/snapshots, command contracts, versions and safety tests. Keep requirements
commands independent from engineering analyzers.

## Completion decision

Do not complete if comment ownership must be guessed or a schema change can be
silently overwritten/ignored. Preserve the documented residual filesystem race;
no atomic multi-file guarantee is promised. TC-1308 consumes the safe authoring path.
