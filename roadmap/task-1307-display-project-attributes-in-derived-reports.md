# Task TC-1307: Display Project Attributes in Derived Reports

Status: Planned

Roadmap stage: 13

Type: Implementation

Depends on: TC-1302, TC-1306

Unlocks: TC-1308

## Question

The existing experimental review report has no place for attribute values or
schema revisions. A stale finding caused by schema meaning would be unexplained
unless the report exposes the actual difference and its source.

## Outcome

The existing derived report displays typed annotations and explains attribute
and schema changes without acquiring authoring or assessment authority.

## Work

- Extend the existing experimental renderer for the new published analysis format; show present values, types, descriptions and selected schema provenance in deterministic name order.
- Show baseline/current attribute and schema-definition changes, including a description-only or unused-enum change under the selected conservative policy. Link to requirement, schema and assertion sources where practical.
- Escape text and retain readable locations when the browser cannot navigate line anchors; mark output as derived and reproducible from source/declaration/plan inputs.
- Reconcile current ReqIF and migration entry points with the explicit unsupported policy: document and verify rejection wherever attribute-bearing input can reach them; do not add a converter or silently flatten values.
- Preserve old report format support where explicitly supported, strict invalid-output rejection and source-independent rendering of supported compiled snapshots.

## Acceptance evidence

- A checked-in example report/golden shows both selected types, optional absence, Unicode/HTML-looking values, a changed value and a changed schema description with visible provenance and safe literal rendering.
- Deleting derived output and rebuilding identical inputs yields identical report bytes; invalid/incomplete or unsupported analysis produces no usable report.
- Existing report tests continue passing, with an explicit migration note for the new result format; output failures remain non-success.
- A capability matrix distinguishes lossless semantic display from unsupported ReqIF/source conversion. Demonstrate existing rejection paths or add only a guard where needed; no claim of external interoperability is made.
- Record focused checks and authoritative verification; generated files are clearly derived and never become project schema definitions.

## Out of scope

- A maintained publishing service, authored composition language, general report styling, external ReqIF roundtrip, attribute editing or assessment approval.

## Compatibility and affected components

Likely components: experiments/0029 renderer and its fixtures, report/interchange
usage documentation and any demonstrated unsupported-input guard. This card extends
the existing report consumer; it does not promote it to a new maintained product.
TC-0807 and TC-0902 retain their independent conditions.

## Completion decision

Stop if a display-only change invents authoritative inverse links or silently
hides changed schema meaning. External mapping remains unsupported until its own
consumer/evidence justifies it. Completion enables source-to-report integration.
