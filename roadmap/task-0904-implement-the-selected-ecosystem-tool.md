# Task TC-0904: Implement the Selected Ecosystem Tool

Status: Ready

Current disposition: Experiment 0024 supplied the repeated workflow evidence
that TC-0901 required and selected a focused verification-plan analyzer. TC-0905
must define and survive a bounded contract experiment before implementation is
unlocked.

Roadmap stage: 9

Type: Implementation

Depends on: TC-0905, TC-1204

Unlocks: TC-0903

## Question

Can the single selected ecosystem capability be delivered as another replaceable tool without expanding the core platform?

## Outcome

One evidence-backed tool is implemented, verified, and documented with an explicit relationship to authoritative source and existing infrastructure.

## Work

- Implement the bounded contract selected by TC-0905, using TC-1204's resolved
  references. Include the selected plan adapter/compiler boundary needed to
  consume authored plans; keep the serialized fixture contract independently usable.
- Reuse shared Java components only where semantic consistency requires it.
- Keep the executable or integration independently usable and removable.
- Ensure outputs are disposable or explicitly external interchange.
- Build with Java 21 and GraalVM Native Image when it is a core command-line tool.
- Run the workflow that justified selection.

## Acceptance evidence

- Published compiled requirement/plan interfaces suffice for a fixture consumer
  without parser-internal access. Golden outputs cover current, stale, uncovered,
  missing-reference, and invalid/partial-input cases with source-linked findings.
- Rebuilding after comment-only, unrelated, normative, ID, and file-move changes
  produces TC-0905's expected binding outcomes. Output failures cannot yield success.
- The tool solves the stated problem in the recorded workflow.
- Removing it does not make authoritative requirements unintelligible.
- It does not absorb unrelated validator, formatter, trace, forge, or editor responsibilities.
- Generated state is reproducible.
- Maintenance and compatibility boundaries are documented separately.

## Out of scope

- Implementing unselected Stage 9 candidates.
- A generalized plugin system.
- A monolithic umbrella command.

## Completion decision

Accept only if the recorded pilot/change fixtures demonstrate the focused
coverage and staleness behavior. Split or stop if unrelated execution, evidence
storage, or satisfaction semantics enter the implementation.

## Compatibility and affected components

Likely components: the selected verification plan adapter/compiler, analyzer,
artifact consumer, independent CLI boundary, and regression fixtures. Source 0.2
and existing tool interfaces stay intact. Analysis reports planned coverage and
staleness rather than approval or requirement satisfaction.

## Planning refinement

Reconciled on 2026-09-04: retain the selected analyzer implementation and add the
bounded linker dependency. Replace the obsolete TC-1001 unlock with the concrete
report experiment. This card implements the chosen workflow, not an umbrella
engineering platform; removing it must leave requirements tools usable.
