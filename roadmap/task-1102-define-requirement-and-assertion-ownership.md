# Task TC-1102: Define Requirement and Assertion Ownership

Status: Ready

Roadmap stage: 11

Type: Decision

Depends on: TC-1101

Unlocks: TC-1103, TC-1301

## Question

Which facts belong to requirements, explicit relationships, or independently
owned assertions when engineering artifacts can be compiled and linked?

## Outcome

A decision matrix establishes ownership, context, revision, and authority
boundaries before choosing syntax or widening the requirement model.

## Work

- Classify ID, title, obligation, rationale, provenance, decomposition, descriptive
  tags, assessed criticality, allocation by variant, verification plans, and results.
- Exercise two simultaneous contexts, a changed assessment of unchanged source,
  product-variant allocation, and an independently revised verification plan.
- State which direction of each relationship is authored and which inverse links
  are derived; retain source locations for the authored assertion.
- Distinguish planned coverage, possible impact, review staleness, and satisfaction.
  Identify what a generic resolver can establish and what requires a domain rule.
- Preserve current built-in fields while examining future additions. Representation
  may be shared across artifact kinds; semantic ownership need not be shared.

## Acceptance evidence

- A checked-in matrix gives each example an owner, required context, revision
  binding, source of authority, and rule for independent change.
- Worked valid and invalid examples show assessed safety levels retaining scheme,
  context, rationale, evidence reference, and authority rather than becoming bare
  timeless requirement attributes.
- A requirement stays identified by its human-authored ID; imported qualification
  resolves scope without creating a second machine identity.
- The record explicitly distinguishes an obligation from an assertion about it and
  states the boundary decisions needed by TC-1103 and TC-1301.

## Out of scope

- Changing grammar, removing allocation or other existing fields, standardizing
  every engineering artifact, or implementing hazard analysis.

## Compatibility and affected components

The 0.2 source contract remains the baseline. Likely inputs are the minimum-model
design record and verification, safety, allocation, and identity studies. New
decisions must explain any changed planning disposition without rewriting evidence.

## Completion decision

Proceed with requirements plus verification planning if the examples can retain
distinct owners and revisions. Stop a proposed generalization when it requires
universal inheritance, behavior, or implicit cross-domain approval semantics.
