# Task TC-0902: Run an Independent ReqIF Roundtrip

Status: Conditional

Roadmap stage: 9

Type: Interchange experiment

Depends on: TC-0603 and access to an independent ReqIF implementation

Unlocks: A maintained-interchange decision

## Question

Does the bounded mundane-req ReqIF profile preserve useful semantics through an independent tool rather than only through self-roundtrip?

## Outcome

A recorded export-edit-import experiment through an independent implementation classifies preserved, transformed, rejected, and lost information.

## Work

- Select and record the exact independent ReqIF implementation and version.
- Export the maintained conformance, UAS, or FRET corpus using the bounded profile.
- Inspect and edit IDs, rich text, relationships, ordering, and at least one unknown attribute in the external tool.
- Import or analyze the resulting document strictly against the profile.
- Compare semantic inventories and ordinary source reconstruction choices.
- Record tool-added metadata and unsupported content separately.

## Acceptance evidence

- The external tool, steps, and exchanged files are reproducible where licensing permits.
- Loss is reported rather than silently flattened.
- Transport identifiers remain distinct from requirement identity.
- No `.mreq` grammar change is made merely to imitate ReqIF.
- The result states whether a maintained converter is justified.

## Out of scope

- Arbitrary ReqIF acceptance.
- Configurable mappings without a real partner need.
- Making ReqIF authoritative storage.

## Completion decision

Expand or maintain interchange only for demonstrated partner workflows. A failed roundtrip is evidence about the profile or tool behavior, not evidence that source-first storage is invalid.
