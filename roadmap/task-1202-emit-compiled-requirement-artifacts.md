# Task TC-1202: Emit Compiled Requirement Artifacts

Status: Planned

Roadmap stage: 12

Type: Implementation

Depends on: TC-1201

Unlocks: TC-1204

## Question

How can requirements be compiled into the selected public representation while
preserving the existing independent validation and formatting interfaces?

## Outcome

A focused compiler boundary emits TC-1201's deterministic requirement artifacts
and diagnostics, with regression evidence for its documented failure behavior.

## Work

- Implement the selected command or API boundary and serialize all current semantic
  fields, reference locations, provenance, and format identifiers.
- Preserve explicit source selection and distinguish source, invocation, input,
  serialization, and output failures.
- Reuse one maintained interpretation. Retain necessary source locations instead
  of making downstream consumers reconstruct them from text.
- Inspect Interpreter.decode, SourceDocument.read, and FormatterMain.format:
  decoding currently occurs repeatedly. Where sharing the interpreted concrete
  document removes duplicate work, verify preservation of source bytes/comments.
  Keep broader refactoring separate if the emitter does not require it.
- Document independent use and extend the authoritative verification command with
  focused artifact checks.

## Acceptance evidence

- Golden files cover multi-file source, both existing language corpora, optional
  fields, math, Unicode, and invalid inputs according to TC-1201.
- Reordered input arguments produce the same normalized semantic output; two runs
  from recorded inputs agree byte-for-byte under the documented provenance policy.
- A fixture consumer reads the artifact without linking requirement-parser classes.
- Fault injection covers closed output, failure after a written prefix, and flush
  failure; no truncated artifact is reported as a successful compilation.
- Any decoding-path change passes formatter idempotence, comment preservation,
  and parse-format-parse checks; current validator/formatter/trace behavior remains
  covered by existing verification.

## Out of scope

- Attribute grammar, a remote artifact registry, generalized compiler infrastructure,
  or performance claims without a profile.

## Compatibility and affected components

Add an explicitly experimental interface; retain existing command names and source
validity. Components: Interpreter, source representation, a focused CLI boundary,
semantic serialization, relevant tests and build targets.

## Completion decision

Accept only a complete TC-1201 implementation with source-linked diagnostics.
Split optimization work if profiling or a larger architectural change is required;
do not expand this card merely to make implementation classes more uniform.
