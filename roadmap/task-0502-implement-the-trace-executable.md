# Task TC-0502: Implement the Trace Executable

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 5

Type: Implementation

Depends on: TC-0204 and TC-0501

Unlocks: TC-0503

## Question

Can the selected trace questions be answered by an independent native tool using only valid authoritative source and disposable memory?

## Outcome

`mundanereq-trace` implements the selected direct, transitive, and impact-oriented operations over the shared semantic model.

## Work

- Build disposable incoming and outgoing indexes from the selected source set.
- Implement the TC-0501 operations and deterministic presentation.
- Reuse shared parsing and diagnostics without depending on validator CLI code.
- Reject invalid source sets and absent IDs clearly.
- Keep all derived indexes process-local and reproducible.

## Acceptance evidence

- The trace executable builds independently as a GraalVM native image.
- No reverse link, cache, or database is written to authoritative source.
- Results match manual traces for maintained corpora.
- Removing formatter or validator executables does not affect trace operation.

## Out of scope

- New relationship syntax.
- Stored matrices.
- A web traceability browser.
- Cross-baseline semantic comparison.

## Completion decision

If an operation needs additional authoritative facts, remove it from this release and create a model-pressure card rather than infer those facts.

## Result

`mundanereq-trace` implements the four TC-0501 operations over the shared valid
semantic result. Trace-local code builds sorted outgoing and derived incoming
indexes, deterministic shortest paths, and reachable strongly connected
components entirely in process memory. It writes no reverse relationships,
cache, database, or repository configuration.

The real trace executable replaces the final temporary native boundary and
builds independently with GraalVM Native Image. Native boundary isolation now
runs a real impact query while validator and formatter binaries are removed in
turn. Shared source selection, parsing, and diagnostics are reused without
calling either sibling CLI.

Focused JVM tests cover all four operations, whole-path tie breaking, lexical
ordering, cycles, self-cycles, disconnected requirements, missing and invalid
IDs, invalid-source precedence, empty results, output failure, and exact
rendering. Broader layout, workflow, and JVM/native evidence remains TC-0503.
