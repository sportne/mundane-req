# Task TC-1104: Establish the Monorepo Component Layout

Status: Conditional

Roadmap stage: 11

Type: Implementation

Depends on: TC-1101

Unlocks: follow-up work selected by the completion decision

## Question

Can the selected monorepo boundaries be made visible without breaking independent
tools, historical evidence, or contributor verification?

## Outcome

The layout selected by TC-1101 is implemented with a reviewable mapping of moved
paths and equivalent observable requirements-tool behavior.

## Work

- Execute only TC-1101's justified moves or dependency boundaries. Keep unrelated
  language changes and cleanup in their own cards.
- Update build/source discovery, documentation links, package assembly, and tests
  affected by those moves. Preserve historical experiment reproducibility or supply
  an explicit compatibility path.
- Keep validator, formatter, and trace independently buildable and installable.
- Add a focused boundary check where a new module boundary prevents an identified
  accidental dependency. Coordinate moves with any active source changes.

## Acceptance evidence

- Before/after path and responsibility inventories explain every move.
- The authoritative verification command and existing command examples pass in a
  clean checkout; semantic inventories and formatter outputs remain equivalent.
- Requirements-only operations succeed without verification or view components;
  the removal-isolation checks still pass.
- Every changed documentation/experiment reference resolves, and no empty
  speculative component or generated authoritative source appears.

## Out of scope

- Repository renaming, a build-system migration, feature implementation, or moving
  historical files solely to make the directory tree uniform.

## Compatibility and affected components

Preserve current source and CLI behavior, package entry points, and the documented
Java/GraalVM baseline. Components are src/, Makefile, distribution/, CI path
references, and component documentation only where the selected moves require it.

## Completion decision

Perform this card only when TC-1101 identifies a measurable boundary or navigation
benefit. If the existing physical layout is sufficient, record that decision and
supersede this card rather than manufacture file movement.
