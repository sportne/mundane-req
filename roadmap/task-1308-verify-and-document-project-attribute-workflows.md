# Task TC-1308: Verify and Document Project Attribute Workflows

Status: Planned

Roadmap stage: 13

Type: Verification and Documentation

Depends on: TC-1302, TC-1304, TC-1306, TC-1307

Unlocks: none

## Question

Owning component checks alone will not show whether a project can retain its
explicit declaration through editing, compilation, imports and review reports, or
whether no-schema projects still behave as documented.

## Outcome

A reproducible multi-file example and bounded workflow corpus establish the
implemented attribute path and a truthful opt-in migration guide.

## Work

- Add a realistic small project using both descriptive types and a medium corpus derived from existing examples, with explicit licensing/provenance and no invented usage feedback. Preserve historical pilot evidence.
- Extend TC-1501's existing corpus strategy with source/schema/value/diagnostic/format/artifact/report goldens, seeded generation and targeted mutations of the new rules. Reuse owning tests rather than duplicate every check.
- Exercise schema absence, isolated files, old source/profile compatibility, source/schema moves, definition revisions, explicit import scopes, strict pins and invalid-publication barriers.
- Publish language-reference examples and migration notes matching implemented flags/formats. Explain no defaults, unchanged old files, conservative schema review staleness and independent assessment ownership.
- Record editor obligations and actual support honestly: structural assistance is not semantic validation; completion/hover require selected project schema; no editor host or attribute assistance is claimed implemented.

## Acceptance evidence

- A clean checkout can author/validate/format/compile/link/analyze/render the example from checked-in source and declarations; deleting all derived artifacts and rebuilding yields equal semantics and identical report bytes.
- Formatter idempotence, parse-format-parse equivalence, optional omission, exact enums and schema-change effects have independent assertions; invalid schema/value cannot produce usable downstream output.
- Bounded reproducible seeds and compilable behavioral mutations include ignored requiredness, invalid enum acceptance and ignored schema changes; record actual results and replay/minimization instructions, not a general coverage claim.
- Existing 0.1-compatible/custom 0.2 and YAML 0.3 corpora retain validity and documented outputs; old-to-new adoption examples identify each deliberate header/configuration change.
- Authoritative verification and documentation/link checks pass; evidence names actual environment, commands and failures. Every published capability is implemented or explicitly unsupported; no external-tool or user-study evidence is invented.

## Out of scope

- Deferring owning regression tests until this card, new attribute types, editor implementation, new artifact languages, long-running deployment studies.

## Compatibility and affected components

Likely components: examples, conformance, experiment 0033 extensions, language and
command documentation, owning verification targets only where integration needs
them. Existing source stays authoritative; generated editor schemas/reports must
not compete with it. No changes to unrelated tooling versions are justified.

## Completion decision

Stop if an example needs unselected defaults, lists or assessment semantics, or
if compatibility requires rewriting existing authored projects without explicit
opt-in. Narrow the example rather than implement extra types. Completion records
bounded evidence and leaves future editor/interchange work conditional.
