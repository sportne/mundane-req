# Task TC-0501: Define the First Trace Interface

Status: Complete

Roadmap stage: 5

Type: Experiment and decision

Depends on: TC-0203

Unlocks: TC-0502

## Question

Which bounded trace questions over `decomposes` are useful enough to standardize for the first trace executable?

## Outcome

A trace-interface decision defines direct and transitive incoming/outgoing questions, path semantics, deterministic ordering, and error behavior.

## Work

- Revisit manual trace friction from sustained authoring and Experiment 0005.
- Define direction in domain language rather than graph jargon alone.
- Decide whether output reports edges, one path, all paths, or bounded summaries for each operation.
- Define deterministic handling of multiple paths and cycles.
- Specify missing-ID and invalid-source behavior.
- Separate structural observations from project-policy failures.

## Acceptance evidence

- Every operation answers a recorded engineering workflow.
- Incoming links remain derived rather than copied into source.
- Output semantics are testable without depending on traversal implementation.
- The interface does not generalize beyond `decomposes` prematurely.

## Out of scope

- Verification coverage or safety relationships.
- A generalized graph query language.
- Persistent indexes or interactive browsers.

## Completion decision

Prefer fewer operations with precise meaning. If a question cannot be explained in requirement-decomposition terms, defer it until its relationship model exists.

## Result

[Research 0016](../research/0016-first-trace-interface.md) selects four
operations over `decomposes`: direct higher-level requirements (`parents`),
direct lower-level requirements (`children`), transitive higher-level paths
(`higher`), and lower-level impact paths (`impact`). Each operation answers a
workflow observed during sustained authoring or provides its direct symmetric
navigation question.

Transitive output contains one deterministic shortest path per distinct
result, choosing the lexicographically least complete path when shortest paths
tie. Results are ordered independently of files and traversal. Reachable cyclic
strongly connected components are emitted as non-fatal structural
observations; they are not redefined as language errors or policy failures.

The decision retains derived incoming links and indexes only in process memory,
defines invalid-source and missing-ID behavior, and rejects generalized edge
queries, every-path enumeration, persistent state, and coverage policy.
